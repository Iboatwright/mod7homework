Chapter 7 Programming Exercise 4. Speeding Violation Calculator
Design a program that calculates and displays the number of miles per hour
    over the speed limit that a speeding driver was doing. The program should
    ask for the speed limit and the driver’s speed. Validate the input as
    follows:
    ● The speed limit should be at least 20, but not greater than 70.
    ● The driver’s speed should be at least the value entered for the
      speed limit
      (otherwise the driver was not speeding).
    Once correct data has been entered, the program should calculate and
    display the number of miles per hour over the speed limit that the driver
    was doing.


Pseudocode
----------
// Global Constants for speed limit constraints.
Constant Integer MIN_SPEED = 20
Constant Integer MAX_SPEED = 70


Module main()
    // Local variables
    Declare Integer speedLimit = 0
    Declare Integer driverSpeed = 0
    Declare String judgement = ''

    // Display intro to user.
     Call fluffy_intro()

    // Get the speed limit.
    Set speedLimit = validate_user_input("speed limit")

    // Get the driver's speed.
    Set driverSpeed = validate_user_input("driver's speed")

    // Calculate driver's speed in reference to the speed limit.
    Set judgement = pass_judgement_on_driver(speedLimit, driverSpeed)

    // Display results.
    Call display_results(judgement)
End Module

// Displays an introduction to the program and describes what it does
Module fluffy_intro()
    Display 'Welcome to the Speeding Violation Calculator.'
    Display 'This program will ask for the speed limit and how fast the'
    Display 'driver was going.  It will then report either how many'
    Display 'miles per hour over the speed limit the driver was going or'
    Display 'that the driver was not speeding.'
